## Fork README

This fork adds a servicepoint2 output.
As I do not think this is useful outside a small user circle, this will probably never be upstreamed.

## Original README

A version of the game [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) powered
by Rust and [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

A WASM version can be played online [here](https://reu.github.io/bevyroids/).
